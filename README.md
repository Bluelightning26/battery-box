I was looking for some batteries for a project and noticed how messy the current battery solution was in my house of stuffing everything in a box. I realized I had a 3d printer and can make anything I want with it; unfortunately I couldn't find anything online that was simple that I liked... so I made one myself! Under 10 hours later, here we are :D

## Features
This box featues 24 slots for AAA batteries and 18 slots for AA batteries. This is easily expandable/alterable with the open source cad files to your liking. The model is designed to be very sturdy, and I printed it at 10% infill with no problems. The fillament cost according to BambuStudio is $1.96 with 97.81 grams used.

## How to print Yourself

This was printed on my Bambu Lab A1 Mini with PLA fillament from Creality. You can find the specific fillament type [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/creality-3d/CR-PLA-BLACK/15964819).

1. Download the files
2. Slice it
I used the Default settings from BambuStudio with the exception of changing the Spare infill from 15% -> 10%. This is as I believe in the structural integerity of this design and this saves on print time and fillament.
